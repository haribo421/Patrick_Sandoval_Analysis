- **Player ID:** 663776
- **Position:** Pitcher
- **Team:** Los Angeles Angels
- **Age:** 26

**How To**

**To search a pitcher’s performance during a time period, use**
# The following example is using Sandoval's start at 2022-06-12
try(statcast_search(start_date = "2022-6-06",
                    end_date = "2022-6-16",
                    playerid = 663776,                 
                    player_type = 'pitcher'))

**R studio only loads certain amount of rows, to load more rows, use**
# To print more rows
%>% print(n = row number)

**put this code behind the original code, for example**

try(statcast_search(start_date = "2022-6-06",
                    end_date = "2022-6-16",
                    playerid = 663776,               
                    player_type = 'pitcher')) %>% print (n = row number)

**To name the tibble as Sandoval, simply add his name in from of the code**
# Name the tibble as Sandoval
Patrick_Sandoval <- try(statcast_search(start_date = "2022-6-06",
                                        end_date = "2022-6-16",
                                        playerid = 663776,                 
                                        player_type = 'pitcher')) %>% print (n = row number)

# To view the data in chart, type:
View(Patrick_Sandoval)

**Next, I will be analyzing Sandoval’s release speed during the start as an example**
# X axis as independent variables, in this case, his pitch type
# Y axis as dependent variables, in this case, his release speed

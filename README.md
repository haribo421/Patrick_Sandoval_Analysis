**This is an independent project analyzing the Los Angeles Angels pitcher Patrick Sandoval's pitching performance for the past three seasons**

My work in progress also available at https://www.notion.so/R-Studio-Project-Baseball-81e8865ff6134593ba5e6c9da841a440?pvs=4

The latest update about this project will be on Notion first, as I often take notes there, I will update my progress on Github asap

This project is meant for myself, and it is my intro to the R world. I will explore the most basic things so if you find it useful that's awesome!

# Filter ROW
# for example, I only want data from the 2020 season

filter(season == 2020)

# Select COLUMNS
# for example, pitch type and spin rate

select(pitch_type, spin_rate)

# Arrange anything in order
# for example, arrange release speed in order

arrange(-release_speed)

# Make New Variables
# changing feet to inches for instance, which is feet*12 = inch
# with pitching movement

mutate(pitching_movement = pitch_movement * 12)

# Summarise Data
# create summary
# for example, summarise the strikes thrown

summarise(Total_Strike = sum(strikes))

# or summarise the average speed of his sinker

summarise(AvgSinkVelo = mean(release_speed))

# Create Sub-Groups
# group by release speed and pitch type

group_by(pitch_type, release_speed)

**Essentially, group_by() function can't be used independently, it helps with the steps to come.**
**You can use group_by() with summarise()
**If you don't use group_by for a dataset and went straight to summarise, R is gonna assume that you want to summarise the whole thing**
**Using group_by helps you to pick the things you want to summarise**
